# Survey automation · v24.0.116

Install the open-source dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run `python survey_with_salad.py` from this directory.

The engine now fuses UIAutomator bounds with OCR coordinates into one confidence-scored form map. Composite Date of Birth screens are resolved as one fact: the agent reads `date_of_birth` from `knowledge_base.json` or `persona_data.py`; if absent, it asks in the terminal for `DD Month YYYY`, persists the declared value, selects Day/Month/Year, verifies all three controls, and taps the right-arrow/Continue control. It never derives DOB from age.

Copy the stable `survey_with_salad.py` entry point and the complete `survey_engine\` folder.
